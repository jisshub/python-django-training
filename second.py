import first
print(__name__)

# here v import first.py file as a module.
# so when v run this it not print __main__. else here, __name__ prints the name of file that imported.

# since second.py doesnt run first.py direclty, instead it import first.py as module

# bt when v print __name__ directly. it prints __main__. since python runs this directly.
